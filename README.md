📌 Project Overview
This is a "Numpy-core-operations" created as part of revising and strengthening core NumPy concepts.  
The project demonstrates how numerical operations can be performed efficiently using NumPy without relying on external libraries like Pandas or Matplotlib.
This project focuses on "clean structure, modular code, and clarity of concepts."

🛠️Technology used
  -Python
  -Numpy(python library)

✨Features
  - Element-wise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
  - Array difference calculation using NumPy
  - Aggregation operations like sum and product
  - Clean modular structure using:
  - `data.py` for input data
  - `utils.py` for NumPy logic
  - `main.py` as the execution entry point
  - Beginner-friendly and readable output

⌨️Keyboard Shortcuts
  Some useful shortcuts used during development:
  - `Ctrl + C` → Stop program execution
  - `Ctrl + S` → Save file
  - `Ctrl + /` → Comment / Uncomment code
  - `Alt + Shift + F` → Format code (VS Code)
  -`#` ->Python comment line

🔄The Process
  1. Revised core NumPy concepts (arrays, ufuncs, arithmetic, diff, aggregation)
  2. Designed a simple project structure
  3. Separated data, logic, and execution into different files
  4. Implemented NumPy operations using reusable functions
  5. Tested outputs by running `main.py`
  6. Refactored code for better readability and correctness

📈Overall Growth
  - Improved confidence in using NumPy
  - Better understanding of debugging and fixing logical errors
  - Learned how real projects are built step-by-step
  - Developed a habit of writing clean and structured code
  - Gained experience in preparing a project for GitHub

🔮How This Project Can Be Improved
  - Add statistical functions like mean, min, and max
  - Include cumulative operations (`cumsum`, `cumprod`)
  - Add file-based output storage
  - Add visualization in future versions (using Matplotlib)
  - Handle edge cases like unequal array sizes

 ▶️How to Run the Project
   -python main.py(open terminal in vscode or any editior ->write python main.py ->code will get executed)
